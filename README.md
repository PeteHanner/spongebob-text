Some people on [/r/CollegeBasketball](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/) were making lots of dumb hot takes that annoyed me, and sometimes sarcastic SpongeBob-ifying their comments is the only appropriate response to these people.

Taking the time and energy to manually type out each comment in sPoNgEbOb FoNt seemed like dignifying them with too much effort... so naturally I went to the effort of making a web app to do it for me. 

This is that web app.
